Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation
Overview
This repository contains my completed job simulation project for Accenture North America's Data Analytics and Visualization role. The project focused on advising a hypothetical social media client by cleaning, modeling, and analyzing multiple datasets to uncover insights into content trends. The goal was to inform strategic decisions and present key findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Project Objectives
Clean and preprocess multiple datasets to ensure data quality.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
Develop and apply data models to generate actionable insights.
Visualize findings using various visualization tools.
Communicate insights effectively through presentations and reports.
